# Hi! My name is Bizzy 👋

### I am a Junior Full Stack Developer, currently working on my pen-ultimate project at Code Institute. 

📚 I am currently building a wedding website with RSVP application. Its a full static website and REST API using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JQuery and MongoDB

👀 I’m interested in full stack development overall. Developing new interests as I learn!

🏊‍♀️ Heading to shore for a sunrise swim is how I start the day

⛰️ Nothing better to clear my head than getting out to the Welsh mountains, walking and wild camping with my husband

🍽️ Meals out are how I like to unwind - the more unusual the food, the better!
